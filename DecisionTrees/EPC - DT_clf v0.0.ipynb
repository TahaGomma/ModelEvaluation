    "Most steps in this notebook might be done in a overly long manner. That is because a lot of this notebook is exploration and testing. For ease, I tried to appropriately label headings. Layers 1 to 3 might be notable (i.e. x.x.x) for the third layer basically contains the bulk of my actions, the first are simply overarching section headers and the second are subsections. Note that I use \"[note]\" as a header tag so that cells (or headers) that solely contain written information are easily distinguishable in the Table of Contents.\n",

    "    3. Delete when 'Description' is missing always\n",

    "3. Questions:\n",
    "    1. Should the x-data be copied for each found entry in the y-data?\n",
    "        1. With 2 improvements and 2 descriptions, would we copy both descriptions on each improvement?\n",
    "    2. How can the data be categorised?\n",
    "        1. Will a get_dummies() be used to simply get a bunch of 1/0 columns?\n",
    "        2. Are there better options?\n",
    "        3. Will I be simply able to expand improvements and descriptions into categories using dummies so that I maintain 1 line per OSG_REF_NUM?\n",
    "    3. Wait, do I actually keep the null-datapoints for improvements and turn them into \"no improvement recommendations\"?"

    "Looking at the wall description, it is clear that each of these descriptions contain different categories within, but extracting these into different columns in an appropriate way is beyond me for now. Therefore, I will do a choppy one-hot encoding onto the 71 different wall descriptions, which in actuality might have been 'feature engineered' into a small number of 'encoded' columns.\n",
    "Columns could have been: _wall type_, _insulation type_, _build type_, and _thermal transmittacne_, and all except the last could have been one-hot encoded into their separate unique entries (seemingly would have resulted in 12 to 20 columns)\n",

    "- Type\n",
    "    - Cavity\n",
    "    - Granity or whinstone\n",
    "    - Timber frame (not wall)\n",

    "    - Solid brick\n",
    "    - ...\n",

    "We can see 1 more unique window description after EXTRACTing them due to \"Description\" being one of them; it might be easier to use a regex to find what is between Description: and | and split based on that. Note, though, that these names don't have to be tidy for the ml model, it would just make it really difficutl to interpret any outcome. For an unrefined model the 17 different columns could be one-hot encoded without name changes since other columns will contain unrefined information as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 5 investigated descriptions, most of them are investigated similarly. The one exception is the windows description, which has 1 value for each house (no multiple ' | ' separated inputs, nor ', ' separated attributes, or so it seemed). The value was preceded by 'Description: ' giving an indication of what the original data might have looked like (it seems, for example, that the description columns and their two proceeding efficiency columns might have looked more similar to the improvements column, but someone might have been processing the data somewhat).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the regular expressions to extract the data into different rows per input found, it can simply be one-hot encoded like shown with the improvements data. Just for reiteration: that data is far from completely cleaned or feature engineered. A small look at ways to better organise this data is in the list above these paragraphs."
