# ModelEvaluation
Training different ML models, primarily based on the IRIS Database but also with inspiration from specific guides and tutorials.

Training the different kind of models, such as decision trees, random forest, linear regressions, etc., on the IRIS Database with the aim of practising model-making and the underlying aim of writing code to be evaluated by Comet (ML evaluation program).

File naming convention based on 'method' (i.e. source of method):
<br />V. - ... - ...: for a script based on (or inspired by) a video (e.g. videotutorials, explanatory videos)
<br />T. - ... - ...: for a script based on (or inspired by) text (e.g. blogs, webguides)
<br />S. - ... - ...: for a script that is not from any one particular source
<br />.T - ... - ...: for a script that follows a tutorial verbatim
<br />.G - ... - ...: for a script that is based on a guide (on the topic) but not a direct copy
<br />.S - ... - ...: for a script that is not directly based on any one (or number of) guides/tutorials
<br />.. - [DS] - ...: dataset indication where, for example, 'ir' refers to the 'iris dataset'
<br />.. - ... - [MLmodel]: dataset determined using the specified ML model where, for example, 'DT' refers to 'Decision Tree(s)'

If there are multiple versions of the exact same 'method' the filename would be sufixed by 'vx.y' where 'x' indicates a specific method; 'v0.0' would always be the first try (or commit).
